# UltimateFullscreenPlus
This is a branch of Ultimate Fullscreen v1.1 from Sebastian Janisz. This contains many improvements and fixes like multiple monitor support and a brand new fullscreen mode.

If you want to support my work, I've been working on a completely new extention to replace UFS+, much more efficient and with capabilities like adapting to any aspect ratio while keeping pixel perfect and adjusting scaling.
